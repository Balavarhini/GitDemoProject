        <h1>Project Overview: MilkFarm Management</h1>

        <section>
            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>
                MilkFarm Management is a web-based application developed to help dairy farmers manage their farm operations more efficiently. The system facilitates the tracking of cows, milk production, feed inventory, and other essential farm resources. By implementing modern software solutions, the goal is to enhance farm productivity and streamline daily operations.

            <h2>Project Architecture</h2>
            <p>
                The MilkFarm Management system follows a layered architecture using a combination of technologies that ensures a scalable, maintainable, and user-friendly application.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Frontend:</strong> The frontend is built using JSP (JavaServer Pages), which allows for dynamic content rendering in the browser. It uses basic HTML, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for client-side interactivity.</li>
                <li><strong>Backend:</strong> The backend is developed using Java with the Spring Boot framework. Spring Boot simplifies the development process, making it easy to configure and deploy the application.</li>
                <li><strong>Database:</strong> MySQL is used as the relational database management system (RDBMS) to store data related to the farm's cows, milk production, inventory, and financials.</li>
                <li><strong>ORM Framework:</strong> Spring Data JPA (Java Persistence API) is used for seamless interaction between the backend and the MySQL database. It abstracts the data persistence layer, allowing easy CRUD operations without writing complex SQL queries.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Technologies Used</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Java</strong>: The core programming language used to develop the backend services of the application.</li>
                <li><strong>Spring Boot</strong>: A framework for building Java-based web applications that simplifies configuration and deployment.</li>
                <li><strong>MySQL</strong>: A relational database used to store the farm's data such as cow records, milk production, and financial information.</li>
                <li><strong>JSP</strong>: JavaServer Pages (JSP) are used to generate dynamic content on the front end. The combination of JSP and Servlets helps deliver a robust web application.</li>
                <li><strong>HTML/CSS/JavaScript</strong>: Standard web technologies for creating and styling the user interface, with minimal use of JavaScript for enhanced interactivity.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>System Features</h2>
            <p>The MilkFarm Management system includes the following key features:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Cow Management:</strong> Users can add, update, and delete cow records, including information about breed, age, and milk production.</li>
                <li><strong>Milk Production Tracking:</strong> The system tracks daily milk production per cow and aggregates the data to generate reports on total production.</li>
                <li><strong>Inventory Management:</strong> Farmers can manage feed inventory and track the consumption of resources.</li>
                <li><strong>Financial Management:</strong> The application helps manage farm finances by tracking costs and revenues related to milk production and inventory.</li>
                <li><strong>Reporting:</strong> The system can generate reports on production, inventory, and finances to help farmers make informed decisions.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>How It Works</h2>
            <p>
                The MilkFarm Management system allows farm administrators to log in, manage records of cows, track milk production, and monitor inventory. The system is designed to handle large-scale dairy operations while remaining easy to use.
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>Users can log in to the system through a secure login page.</li>
                <li>After logging in, they are directed to a dashboard where they can view key metrics and quickly navigate to different sections like cow management, milk production, and inventory.</li>
                <li>Data is stored in MySQL, and CRUD operations are performed via the Spring Boot backend using Spring Data JPA.</li>
                <li>The frontend interacts with the backend using standard HTTP requests (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) to retrieve and manipulate data.</li>
            </ol>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>
                MilkFarm Management is designed to improve the efficiency and productivity of dairy farms by leveraging modern technologies. By integrating user-friendly web interfaces with a powerful backend, this system aims to simplify farm management tasks and support better decision-making for farmers.
